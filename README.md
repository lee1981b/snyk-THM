# THM Snyk Open Source   

Jessica has just graduated from college with a degree in Computer Science and landed her dream job as a Junior Application Security Engineer at Patch Corp. Although passionate about cybersecurity, she admits she still has much to learn. Fortunately, she possesses excellent problem-solving skills, a keen interest in technology, and a determination to grow professionally.

Her CISO tasked her with improving the security posture of Patch Corp's software development ecosystem. After conducting a gap analysis, she discovered that some teams didn't have a dependency and package scanners, leaving the organisation exposed to potential vulnerabilities within third-party libraries and components.

To tackle this issue, Jessica will implement Snyk Open Source, a security tool recently acquired by the company. The security team decided to do a phased adoption plan, and Jessica aimed to introduce the tool gradually to all developer teams, ensuring maximum engagement and utilisation.

She will introduce the tool to one project, allowing the team to familiarise themselves with it and report any issues encountered during implementation. Once this phase proves successful, Jessica will expand the tool's usage to additional projects.
